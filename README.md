## LAB 3 - Designing pipelined MIPS on FPGA
![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Pipeline_MIPS.png)
#### TThe aim of this laboratory is to design a simple MIPS compatible CPU. The CPU will use a PIPELINED architecture and must be capable of performing instructions from MIPS instruction set. The design will be executed on the Altera Board. The MIPS architecture is Harvard architecture in order to increase throughput and simplify the logic. There is need to implement floating point instructions (ADD, SUB and MUL from previous work) and floating-point register file.
